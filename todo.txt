I want a cable that feels like an EnderIO conduit.

I wish to be able to attach it to blocks like EnderIO does when you right click
the cable with a yeta wrench in the direction of the block.

When you shift left click the part that connects to the block, a gui should pop up.

In that gui you can insert modules that enables you to use the network. For example you can insert an ItemModule,
FluidModule or EnergyModule.
After inserting an ItemModule, you should see a tab appear for Items. In that tab you can configure the ItemModule.
I think you should be able to configure it like an EnderIO item conduit.
